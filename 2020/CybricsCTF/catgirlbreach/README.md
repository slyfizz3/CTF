## Solution

1. Extract the file [do_not_pet_me.exe](do_not_pet_me.exe)
2. Extract main.exe from madoka.bat
3. Use [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) to extract [main.py](./main.py) from main.exe
4. Yhan you can get another source code by replace exec to print and than you can get [extract.py](./extract.py)
5. finally reverse it ([reversable.py](./reversable.py)) and you can get the [flag](./flag.png)
